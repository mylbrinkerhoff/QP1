\section{Negative indefinite shifting} \label{sec:NEGSHIFT}
%------------------------------------
\ea Negative Shifting (NegShift) is a process in the Scandinavian languages where a negative indefinite (NI) obligatorily shifts to a position outside of the VP.
	\ea
	\gll Manden havde måske \textit{ingenting} [\textsubscript{VP} sagt t\textsubscript{o} ].\\
	man-the had probably nothing ~ said\\
	\glt `The man hadn't said anything.'
	\ex 
	\gll Jeg har \textit{ingen} \textit{bøger} [\textsubscript{VP} lånt børnene t\textsubscript{o}.]\\
	I have no books ~ lent children-the\\
	\glt `I haven't lent the children any books.'
	\z
\ex This process occurs to all NIs and is permissible from a large number of different contexts, depending on the variety and register, see Table \ref{tab:Distribution}. 
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\caption{Distribution of NegShift across Scandinavian languages. WJ = West Jutlandic, Ic = Icelandic, Fa = Faroese, DaL = Danish Linguists, SwL = Swedish Linguists, Scan1 = literary/formal Mainland Scandinavian, Scan2 = colloquial Mainland Scandinavian and Norwegian}
	\label{tab:Distribution}
\begin{tabular}{llccccccccc}
	\hline 
	NegS across &  & WJ1 & WJ2 & Ic & Fa & DaL1 & DaL2 & SwL & Scan1 & Scan2 \\ 
	\hline 
	String-vacuous &  & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ \\ 
	Verb &  & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & * \\ 
	IO & verb in situ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & * \\

	& verb moved & ✔︎ & * & * & ✔︎ & * & * & * & * & * \\ 
	\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

\newpage
\ex However, not all NegShift is treated equal. \citet[65f]{christensenInterfacesNegationSyntax2005}, speaking on Danish, claims that the "weight" of the NI plays a factor in whether or not NegShift occurs. 
	\ea
	\gll Jeg har \textit{intet}\textsubscript{o} hørt t\textsubscript{o}.\\
	I have nothing heard\\
	\glt  `I havn't heard anything.'
	\ex 
	\gll Jeg har [\textit{intet} \textit{nyt}]\textsubscript{o} hørt t\textsubscript{o}.\\
	I have nothing new heard\\
	\glt `I haven't heard anything new'
	\ex[*] {
	\gll Jeg har [\textit{intet} \textit{nyt} \textit{i} \textit{sagen}]\textsubscript{o} hørt t\textsubscript{o}.\\
	I have nothing new in case-\textsc{det} heard\\
	\glt `I haven't heard anything new about the case.'
	}
	\ex[*] {
	\gll Jeg har [\textit{intet} \textit{nyt} \textit{i} \textit{sagen} \textit{om} \textit{de} \textit{stjålne} \textit{malerier}]\textsubscript{o} hørt t\textsubscript{o}.\\
	I have nothing new in case-\textsc{det} about the stolen paintings heard\\
	}
	\glt `I haven't heard anything new in the case about the stolen paintings.'
	\z
\ex In those instances where the NI is too large one potential repair is to strand the PP while moving just the pronoun or using the negative particle \textit{ikke} and a NPI.
	\ea Jeg har \textit{intet}\textsubscript{i} hørt t\textsubscript{i} [\textsubscript{PP} i sagen om de stjålne malerier ].
	\ex Jeg har ikke hørt [ \textit{noget} i sagen om de stjålne malerier ].
	\z   
\ex This same behavior has also been remarked upon by \citet{penkaNegativeIndefinites2011} for Swedish.
	\ea 
	\gll Men mänskligheten har \textit{ingenting}\textsubscript{o} lärt sig t\textsubscript{o}.\\
	but mankind-the have nothing taught themselves\\
	\glt `But mankind haven't taught themselves anything.'
	\ex[?] {
	\gll Vi hade \textit{inga} \textit{grottor}\textsubscript{o} undersökt t\textsubscript{o}.\\
	we have no caves explored\\
	}
	\glt `We haven't explored any caves.'
	\z 
\ex My QP explores whether or not there is indeed this preference for NegShift of pronouns by conducting a study on the Swedish Culturomics Gigaword Corpus \citep{eideSwedishCulturomicsGigaword2016} and how this phenomenon might relate to prosodic analyses of pronominal obejct shift.
\ex One of the issues for this analysis is that one of the NI pronouns (\textit{ingen|inget|inga}) is identical to the NI determiner (\textit{ingen|inget|inga}).
\z

% \section{Engels 2012} \label{sec:ENGELS}
% %------------------------------------

% \ea \citet{engelsScandinavianNegativeIndefinites2012} provides a very nice table outlining the types of NegS that is allowed in the different Scandinavian languages. I will first present this table and will have examples of the different types of shifting in subsections following the table.
% \ex For each of the subsections they are further subdivided into whether or not the verb remains in situ or has moved.
% \ex In the following table  ✔︎ indicates that NegS occurs, * indicates that NegS cannot occur, ? means that there was idiosyncratic  variation 
% \z

% \begin{table}[h!]
% 	\centering
% 	\caption{Distribution of NegS across the different Scandinavian languages. WJ = West Jutlandic, Ic = Icelandic, Fa = Faroese, DaL = Danish Linguists, SwL = Swedish Linguists, Scan1 = literary/formal Mainland Scandinavian varieties, Scan2 = colloquial Mainland Scandinavian varieties and Norwegian}

% 	\hline 
% \end{tabular} 
% \end{table}

% %------------------------------------
% \subsection{String-vacuous NegS}
% %------------------------------------

% \ea According to \citeauthor{engelsScandinavianNegativeIndefinites2012} all varieties allow string-vacuous NegS
% 	\ea 
% 	\gllllll Ég sagði \textit{ekkert} \I[VP t\textsubscript{v}  t\textsubscript{o}  ]\jambox{Ic}\\
% 			Eg segði \textit{einki} \I[VP t\textsubscript{v}  t\textsubscript{o}  ]\jambox{Fa}\\
% 			Jeg sagde \textit{ingenting} \I[VP t\textsubscript{v}  t\textsubscript{o}  ]\jambox{Da}\\
% 			Jag sa \textit{ingenting} \I[VP t\textsubscript{v}  t\textsubscript{o}  ]\jambox{Sw}\\
% 			Jeg sa \textit{ingenting} \I[VP t\textsubscript{v}  t\textsubscript{o}  ]\jambox{No}\\
% 			I said nothing\\
% 	\glt `I said nothing'
% 	\z 
% \z

% %------------------------------------
% \subsection{NegS across verbs}
% %------------------------------------

% \ex. NegS may cross a verb in situ in Insular Scandinavian languages
% \ag. Ég hef \textit{engan} \textbf{séð} t\textsubscript{o}. \\
% I have nobody seen\\
% `I haven't seen anybody.'\rcommentg{Ic}
% \bg. {Í dag} hevur Petur \textit{einki} \textbf{sagt} t\textsubscript{o}\\
% today has Peter nothing said\\
% `peter hasn't said anything today.'\rcommentg{Fa}

% \ex. It is claimed that NegS across a verb in situ is found in literature to be stylistically marked. However, it is reported that there is dialectal variation (e.g., West Jutlandic). It was also deemed grammatical by Danish and Swedish linguists.
% \a. Manden havde måske \textit{ingenting} \textbf{sagt} t\textsubscript{o}.\hfill Scan1
% \bg. *Manden havde måske \textit{ingenting} \textbf{sagt} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% man-the had probably nothing said\\
% `The man hadn't said anything'\rcommentg{Scan2}


% %------------------------------------
% \subsection{NegS across IO}
% %------------------------------------

% \ex. NegS across IO is permitted if the verb remains in situ for Icelandic, Faroese, West Jutlandic, and Scandinavian1
% \ag. Jón hefur \textit{ekkert} \textbf{sagt} \textbf{Sveini} t\textsubscript{o}. \\
% Jón has nothing said Sveinn\\
% `John hasn't told Sveinn anything'\rcommentg{Ic}
% \bg. {Í dag} hevur Petur \textit{einki} \textbf{givið} \textbf{Mariu} t\textsubscript{o}. \\
% today has Peter nothing given Mary\\
% `Today, Peter hasn't given Mary anything.'\rcommentg{Fa}
% \cg. Jeg har \textit{ingen} \textit{bøger} \textbf{lånt} \textbf{børnene} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% I have no books lent children-the\\
% `I haven't lent the children any books.'\rcommentg{WJ/Scan1}
% \d. *Jeg har \textbf{ingen bøger} lånt børnene t\textsubscript{o}.\hfill Scan2
% \z.

% \ex. If the verb has undergone V-to-T-to-C movement, NegS is deemed ungrammatical in all varieties.
% \ag. *Jón sagði \textit{ekkert} \textbf{Sveini} t\textsubscript{o}\\
% Jón said noting Sveinn\\
% Intended: `John didn't tell Sveinn anything.'\rcommentg{Ic}
% \bg. *{Í gjár} gv Petur \textit{einki} \textbf{Mariu} t\textsubscript{o}\\
% yesterday gave Peter nothing Maria\\
% Intended: `Yesterday, Peter didn't give Mary anything.'\rcommentg{Fa}
% \cg. *Jeg lånte \textit{ingen} \textit{bøger} \textbf{børnene} t\textsubscript{o}\\
% I lent no books children-the\\
% Intended: `I didn't lend the children any books.'\rcommentg{WJ/Scan1}

% %------------------------------------
% \subsection{NegS across preposition}
% %------------------------------------

% \ex. NegS across a preposition is not permitted in Mainland Scandinavian.
% \ag. *Jeg har \textit{ingen} \textbf{peget} \textbf{på} t\textsubscript{o} \\
% I have nobody pointed at\\
% Intended: `I haven't pointed at anybody.'\rcommentg{Scan1/Scan2}
% \bg. *Jeg pegede \textit{ingen} \textbf{på} t\textsubscript{o}\\
% I pointed nobody at\\
% Intended: `I didn't point at anybody.'

% \ex. According to \posscitet{engelsScandinavianNegativeIndefinites2012} investigation there is considerable variation in this regard. It is permitted by the majority of Danish linguists at University of Aarhus, but ungrammatical if the verb has moved.
% \a. ?Jeg har \textit{ingen} \textbf{peget på} t\textsubscript{o}. \hfill DaL
% \b. ?Jeg har pegede \textit{ingen} \textbf{på} t\textsubscript{o}

% \ex. Permitted in Faroese if the the verb remains in situ.
% \ag. {Í dag} hevur Petur \textit{ongan} \textbf{tosað} \textbf{við} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% today has Peter nobody spoken with\\
% `Today Peter hasn't spoken with anybody.'\rcommentg{Fa}
% \bg. *{Í dag} tosaði Petur \textit{ongan} \textbf{við} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% today spoke Peter nobody with\\
% Intended: `Today Peter didn't speak with anybody.'

% \ex. In Icelandic, NegS is permitted if the verb remains in situ. If the verb has moved, it is still grammatical but degraded.
% \ag. Ég hef \textit{engan} \textbf{talið} \textbf{við} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% I have nobody spoke with\\
% `I have spoken to nobody'\rcommentg{Ic}
% \bg. ?Ég talaði \textit{engan} \textbf{við} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% I spoke nobody with\\
% `I spoke with nobody.'

% \ex. In West Jutlandic, NegS is always permitted across prepositions.
% \ag. Måske har hun \textit{ingen} \textbf{snakket} \textbf{med} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% maybe has she nobody spoken with\\
% `She maybe hasn't spoken with anybody.'\rcommentg{WJ}
% \bg. {I går} snakkede hun \textit{ingen} \textbf{med} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% yesterday spoke she nobody with\\
% `Yesterday, she didn't speak with anybody.'

% %------------------------------------
% \subsection{NegS out of infinitival clauses}
% %------------------------------------

% \ex. Icelandic allows NegS out of infinitival clauses if the matrix verb has remained in situ.
% \ag. Hún hefur \textit{engan} \textbf{lofað} \textbf{að} \textbf{kyssa} t\textsubscript{o}\\
% she has nobody promised to kiss\\
% `She hasn't promised to kiss anybody.'\rcommentg{Ic}
% \bg. *Hún lofaði \textit{engan} \textbf{að} \textbf{kyssa} t\textsubscript{o}, var það nokkuð?\\
% she promised nobody to kiss {} was it rather\\
% Intended: `she didn't promise to kiss anybody, did she?'

% \ex. It is also reported that Icelandic allows NegS out of multiple infinitival clauses if the verb reamains in situ.
% \ag. Petúr hefur \textit{engu} \textit{bréfi} \textbf{lofað} \textbf{að} \textbf{reyna} \textbf{að} \textbf{svara} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% Peter has no letter promised to try to reply\\
% `Peter hasn't promised to try to reply to any letter.'\rcommentg{Ic}

% \ex. NegS out of a infinitival clause is also permitted by some of the Danish linguists and for some west Jutlandic speakers if the verb has remained in situ. This is also the case for some of the Swedish linguists.
% \ag. Han har \textit{ingen} \textit{kager} \textbf{lovet} \textbf{at} \textbf{købe} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% he has no cakes promised to buy\\
% `He hasn't promised to buy any cakes.'\rcommentg{DaL1/WJ2}
% \bg. *Han lovede \textit{ingen} \textit{kager} \textbf{at} \textbf{købe} t\textsubscript{o}, vel?\\
% he promised no cakes to buy {} well\\
% Intended: `He didn't promise to buy any cakes, did he?'
% \cg. ?Per har \textit{inga} \textit{tårta} \textbf{lovat} \textbf{att} \textbf{köpa} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
%  Per has no cake promised to buy\\
%  `Per hasn't promised to buy any cake'\rcommentg{SwL}
% \dg. *Per lovade \textit{ingen} \textit{tårta} \textbf{att} \textbf{köpa} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% Per promised no cake to buy\\
% Intended: `Per didn't promise to buy any cake.'

% \ex. Other Danish linguists do not permit NegS out of infinitive clauses at all. This is also true for Scandinavian1 and Scandinavian2.
% \a. *Han har \textit{ingen} \textit{kager} \textbf{lovet} \textbf{at} \textbf{købe} t\textsubscript{o}. \hfill DaL2
% \b. *Han lovede \textit{ingen} \textit{kager} \textbf{at} \textbf{købe} t\textsubscript{o}, vel?
% \cg. *Han har \textit{ingen} \textit{bøker} \textbf{prød} \textbf{å} \textbf{lese} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% he has no books tried to read\\
% Intended: `He hasn't tried to read any books.'\rcommentg{No}  
% \dg. *Han prøvde \textit{ingen} \textit{bøker} \textbf{å} \textbf{lese} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% he tried no books to read\\
% Intended: `He didn't try to read any books.'
 
% \ex. For other West Jutlandic speakers and Faroese NegS is permitted regardless if the matrix verb has moved or not.
% \a. Han har \textit{ingen} \textit{kager} \textbf{lovet} \textbf{at} \textbf{købe} t\textsubscript{o}. \hfill WJ1
% \b. Han lovede \textit{ingen} \textit{kager} \textbf{at} \textbf{købe} t\textsubscript{o}, vel?
% \cg. Allarhelst hevur Petur \textit{einki} \textbf{roynt} \textbf{at} \textbf{eta} t\textsubscript{o}. \\
% probably has Peter nothing tried to eat\\
% `Peter probably hasn't tried to eat anything.'\rcommentg{Fa}
% \dg. Allarhelst royndi Petur heldur \textit{einki} \textbf{at} \textbf{eta} t\textsubscript{o}.\\
% probably tried Peter also nothing to eat\\
% `Peter probably also didn't try to eat anything.'

\section{Scandinavian pronouns} \label{sec:PRONOUNS}
%------------------------------------

\ea There two different approaches that we can take when accounting for the syntactic structure of the negative indefinite pronouns in Swedish. The two positions are: (a) the pronoun is the head of a DP on its own; or (b) the pronoun resides in D and takes a null NP complete.\footnote{This second option could also assume that the pronoun originated in NP and moved to D prior to spell-out of the DP phase.}
	\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex DP with no complement \label{ex:NNP}\\
		\begin{tikzpicture} 
		\tikzset{every tree node/.style={align=center,anchor=north}} 
		\Tree [.DP\\\emph{pronoun} ] 
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\vspace{2em}\\
		\ex DP with null NP complement \label{ex:DN} \\
		\begin{tikzpicture} 
		\tikzset{every tree node/.style={align=center,anchor=north}} 
		\Tree [.DP D\\\emph{pronoun} [.NP\\$\varnothing$ ] ]
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{xlist}
	\end{multicols}
\ex The reason this question is interesting is the presence of two homophonous NIs. 
	\ea the first is the negative indefinite determiner which always appears with a nominal pivot. This is equivalent to our NI determiner \emph{no}.
		\ea 
		\gll Jag bakade honom [\textsubscript{DP} \emph{inget} kaka ].\\
		I baked him ~ no cake\\
		\glt `I didn't bake him any cake.'  
		\ex 
		\gll Hon såg \emph{inga} barn.\\
		she saw no children\\
		\glt `She didn't see any children.'
		\z  
	\ex The second is the negative indefinite pronoun which does not take a nominal pivot and stands independent or with an adjunct, similar to English's \emph{no-one} or \emph{none}.
		\ea 
		\gll Jag bakade honom \emph{inget}.\\
		I baked him none\\
		\glt `I didn't bake him anything.'
		\ex 
		\gll  Jag har \textit{ingen} lånt barnen.\\
		I have none lent children-the\\
		\glt `I haven't lent the children anything.'
		\z 
	\z
\ex Evidence for one structure over the other comes from whether or not modification of the pronoun is allowed. 
	\ea Modification is taken to be additional material that changes what the set of things the NI refers too. 
	\ex This is predominately done with PPs, relative clauses, or infinitival clauses (when the NI is an object of an existential clause).
	\z 
\ex Because of this difference in behavior between determiners and nouns, we can gather evidence that would suggest one of the two syntactic structures is the more likely one for the Swedish negative indefinite pronouns if modification of these pronouns is present.
\ex Data will be drawn from across all of the Scandinavian languages because of the close similarity between the mainland Scandinavian languages syntactically.
\ex We observe in Danish that their negative indefinite pronouns are able to be modified with PPs and CPs as shown in \citet[218ff]{allanDanishComprehensiveGrammar1995}.
	\ea PPs
		\ea 
		\gll Det er \textit{intet} [\textsubscript{PP} i vej-an ].\\
			It is nothing ~ in way-\textsc{det}\\
		\glt `There is nothing wrong'
		\ex 
		\gll Jeg kender \textit{ingen} [\textsubscript{PP} her i byen ].\\
			I know no-one ~ here in town\\
		\glt `I know no one in this town.'
		\z
	\ex CPs
		\ea 
		\gll Der er \textit{ingen}, [\textsubscript{CP} der har set ham ].\\
		there is no-one, ~ who has seen him\\
		\glt `Nobody has seen him'
		\ex
		\gll Der er \textit{intet} [\textsubscript{CP} at være bange for ].\\
		There is nothing ~ to be afraid of\\
		\glt `There is nothing to be afraid of'
		\z 
	\z
\ex This same behavior is also observed in Swedish \citep[197ff]{holmesSwedishComprehensiveGrammar2013}.
	\ea PPs
		\ea \label{ex:inget}
		\gll Han äger \textit{inget} [\textsubscript{PP} av värde ].\\
			He owns nothing ~ of value\\
		\glt `He owns nothing of value.'
		\z 
	\ex CPs
		\ea
		\gll Jag såg \textit{ingen} [\textsubscript{CP} jag {kände igen} ].\\

\ex Example (\ref{ex:inget}) shows the use of \textit{inget} instead of \textit{ingenting} which according to \citet{holmesSwedishComprehensiveGrammar2013} are in free variation.

\ex Based on this data, we see adjunct extraposition, which is assumed to be the result of the adjunction site of these PPs and CPs being within NP.
	\ea This is a working hypothesis and I am currently looking for further independent evidence that this is is the correct analysis for pronominals in Swedish.
	\z 
\ex Another reason that we can assume that (\ref{ex:DN}), repeated below with a adjunct, is the correct structure, is that if we assume that (\ref{ex:NNP}) is the structure for pronouns then we are left wondering how exactly these pronominal modifiers attach to our structure.

\section{Broekhuis 2020} \label{sec:BROEKHUIS}
%------------------------------------

\ea \cite{broekhuisUnificationObjectShift2020} explores the possibility that object shift and object scrambling are the same phenomenon and concludes that this is in fact the case.
\ex However, \citeauthor[417f]{broekhuisUnificationObjectShift2020} does point out that weak pronominal object shift behaves differently than full DP objects in what loci there are allowed to inhabit. In the case of weak pronominals they are required to appear outside of the \textit{v}P if there is no intervening phonological material (i.e., Holmberg's Generalization \cite{holmbergWordOrderSyntactic1986,holmbergRemarksHolmbergGeneralization1999}).
\ex \citeauthor{broekhuisUnificationObjectShift2020} does have some interesting discussion about the interaction of NegShift and pronominal OS. 
\ex Citing examples from \citet[163ff]{christensenInterfacesNegationSyntax2005}, Broekhuis shows this pair of examples:
	\ea \label{ex:NegShift}
	\gll Jeg har <ingen bøger> lånt hende <*ingen bøger>.\\
	I have no books lent her\\
	\glt `I haven't lent her any books
	\ex \label{ex:NegOS}
	\gll Jeg lånte \textit{henda} fraktisch \textit{ingen} \textit{bøger}.\\
	I lent her actually no books\\
	\glt `I didn't actually lend her any books.'
	\z
\ex In (\ref{ex:NegShift}), we see that when we have a negative object that it shifts to a position higher than the \textit{v}P if it were to remain in-situ as it would be ungrammatical and would require the use of \textit{ikke} `not' and the NPI \textit{nogen}.
	\ea
	\gll Jeg har \textit{ikke} lånt hende \textit{nogen} bøger.\\
	I have not lent her any books.\\
	\glt `I haven't lent her any books.'
	\z
\ex However, when the main verb has raised to C⁰ as in (\ref{ex:NegOS}) then the weak pronominal moves to a position higher than the adverb \textit{fraktisch} `actually'. The negative object is not able to move to the similar position that is higher than the adverb. Additionally, this results in OS > NegShift and according to \citeauthor{broekhuisUnificationObjectShift2020} this is a universal fact.
\ex This does help us see that that even though these two phenomena appear to be similar they are in fact slightly different, due to the differences in the where the different movement operations' target is.

\section{Valentine Bordal 2017} \label{sec:VB}
%------------------------------------

\ea \citet{valentinebordalNegationExistentialPredications2017} is a corpus study of \textit{Språkbanken}\footnote{\url{https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en}} looking at how existential predicates are negated in Swedish.
\ex According to \citeauthor{valentinebordalNegationExistentialPredications2017} declarative sentences are negated using the negative particle \textit{inte} only. 
	\ea
	\gll Anna är \textit{inte} doktor.\\
	Anna is not doctor\\
	\glt `Anna is not a doctor.'
	\z 
\ex If the verbal predicate has a non-lexical verb (i.e., modals and auxiliaries) then the sentence is negated with either the negative particle \textit{inte} or with a negative indefinite.\footnote{I disagree with her claim that NIs are only used with non-lexical verbs, because there are plenty of examples in the literature that show NIs negating sentences that contain lexical verbs (see \cite{engelsScandinavianNegativeIndefinites2012} and \cite{christensenInterfacesNegationSyntax2005} for examples).} 
	\ea
	\gll Jag har \textit{inte} några barn.\\
	I have not any children\\
	\glt `I don't have any children'
	\ex 
	\gll Jag har \textit{inga} barn.\\
	I have no children\\
	\glt `I don't have children.'
	\z 
\ex According to her results, NIs were the most frequent method for negating existential predicates. 
	
	\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\caption{Frequency of negation strategy}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
	\hline
	Negated existential & Raw count & Proportion\\
	\hline
	Existential predicates negated with an indefinite pronoun & 212 918 & 89\% \\
	Existential predicates negated with inte & 27 437 & 11\% \\
	\hline
	Total & 240 355 & 100\%  \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

\ex Under her analysis of NIs, they are all treated as a pronomial which can or cannot appear with a nominal pivot.
	\ea This means that her "modifier" is best treated as a NI determiner which appears with a nominal pivot and her "head" is best treated as a pronoun which doesn't appear with a nominal pivot.
	\z 

	\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\caption{Frequency of NI property}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
	Syntactic property of the NI & Frequency & Proportion\\
	\hline
	Modifier & 687 & 78\% \\
	Head & 198 & 22\% \\
	\hline
	Total & 885 & 100\%  \\
	\hline 
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

\ex She also claims that out of all the negative indefinites, \textit{inga} only appears as a modifier, \textit{ingen} and \textit{inget} both appear equally as modifiers and pronominal heads, and \textit{ingenting} only ever appear as a head.

\section{Zeijlstra 2011} \label{sec:ZEIJLSTRA}
%------------------------------------

\ea \cite{zeijlstraSyntacticallyComplexStatus2011} is interested in showing providing an analysis of the split-scope interpretation that exists for negative indefinites in Germanic languages. 
\ex Split-scope is evident when modals and other auxiliaries are present and the negation scopes higher than the modal/auxiliary's scope where the indefinite resides. 
\ex \citeauthor{zeijlstraSyntacticallyComplexStatus2011} assumes that this behavior is the result of the compositional status of negative indefinites similar to the claims made by \citet{iatridouNegativeDPsAMovement2011}. Unlike \citeauthor{iatridouNegativeDPsAMovement2011}, who simply claim that negation takes scope higher than the modal's scope and the indefinite scopes low, he claims that NIs are composed of a negative operator and an indefinite component.
\ex He further claims that the split-scope interpretation is the result of a copy-theory of movement where the indefinite interpretation is interpreted in the lower copy while the negative operator is interpreted in the higher copy after quantifier rising.

\section{Interaction of NegShift and OS} \label{sec:NEG-OS}
%------------------------------------

\ea \citet{christensenInterfacesNegationSyntax2005} provides a clear and detailed summary of the interactions of OS and NegShift. His summary is detailed below in Table \ref{tab:OSNEGS}.
\ex In this table No\textsuperscript{+}/Sw\textsuperscript{+} represent some varieties of Norwegian and Swedish respectively in contrast to more standard Norwegian (No) and Swedish (Sw), FS represent the Swedish variety which is spoken by Swedes in Finland.
\begin{table}[!h]

\hline 
\end{tabular}\\
(KEY: + = obligatory, - = blocked, \% = optional, § = optional and `non-parallel’)
\end{table}

\ex The sections on this table that are most interesting are those involving what \citeauthor{christensenInterfacesNegationSyntax2005} calls Negative Quantifier Phrases, which is equivalent to NIs. However, this does conflate NI determiners and NI pronouns into a single category.
\ex According to \citeauthor{christensenInterfacesNegationSyntax2005}, when the IO is a pronoun and the DO is a NegQP both obligatorily shift when the verb has been able to swift to C, (a), otherwise only the NegQP shifts, (b).
	\ea 
	\gll Jeg lånte \textit{hende(IO)} faktisk \textit{ingen} \textit{bøger(DO)}\\
	I lent her actually no books\\
	\glt `I actually didn't lend her any books'
	\ex 
	\gll Jeg har \textit{ingen} \textit{bøger(DO)} lånt \textit{hende(IO)}\\
	I have no books lend her\\
	\glt `I didn't lend her any books'
	\z 
\ex If, however, the IO is a NegQP and the DO is a pronoun then the pronoun is blocked from shifting. \textbf{This produces a freezing effect on OS \citep[164]{christensenInterfacesNegationSyntax2005}.}
	\ea 
	\gll Jeg lånte faktisk \textit{ingen(IO)} \textit{den(DO)}\\
	I lent actually no-one it\\
	\glt `I actually lent it to no-one.'
	\ex[*] {Jeg lånte \textit{den(DO)} faktisk \textit{ingen(IO)}} 
	\z
\ex This is actually a very important point for the question of the prosodic nature of the shifting. If we assume that these are moving to a position outside of the VP or are some sort of adjunct to VP\footnote{This is actually well argued by \citet{thrainssonSyntaxIcelandic2010} because if it was the head of a NegP that resided above the VP then we would assume that Neg, including NIs, should block head movement from occurring. Because we do not observe this and instead we see Neg and its reflexes acting more along the lines of actual adverbs. However, I am not entirely convinced as will be seen in (\ref{ex:HGfail})} then we would assume that OS should be allowed according to Holmberg's Generalization, (a). 
	\ea Object Shift cannot apply across a phonologically visible category asymmetrically c-commanding the object position except adjuncts \citep[15]{holmbergRemarksHolmbergGeneralization1999}.
	\z 
\ex \label{ex:HGfail} However, this might not actually be the case if we follow the logic from Holmberg's Generalization. HG requires that OS occur if there is not a phonologically visible category that asymmetrically c-commands the object's base position. Because OS is blocked, then Neg is a phonologically visible category that asymmetrically c-commands the object and is not an adjunct. This then suggests that it is a head of a phrase, where the head asymmetrically c-commands the object. This leaves us with two possibilities: either, (i) the NI does not move in these contexts; or (ii) the NI does move but to the head of some phrase that is in the domain of HG.
\ex Additionally, when the IO is a full DP and the DO is a NegQP the full DP IO induces a freezing effect on overt NegShift, which results in NegShift occurring covertly. This is also true when the IO is left in-situ, (b).
	\ea 
	\gll Ég gaf \emph{manninum(IO)} víst \textit{enga} \textit{gjöf(DO)}\\
	I gave man-the.\textsc{dat} \textsc{prt} no present\\
	\glt `But i di give the man the present'
	\ex Ég gaf víst \textit{manninum(IO)} \textit{enga} \textit{gjöf(DO)}

\section{Adverbial orders} \label{sec:ADV}
%------------------------------------

\ea There was some discussion about \emph{faktisch} `actually' being the wrong type of adverb to show movement of NIs and object pronouns. 
\ex However looking into the ordering of adverbs this actually seems to be the best type of adverb. This is because there is a strict ordering of adverbs in the middle field. 
\ex \citet{holmesIntroductionSociolinguistics2017} stats that there are four distinct levels that these adverbs are allowed to appear in.
	\ea The first level contains short modal adverbs\\

	\emph{då} `then'
	\ex The second level contains short pronominal adverbs or conjunctional adverbs\\
	\emph{därför} `therefore'
	\ex The third level contains longer modal adverbs\\
	\emph{faktiskt} `actually'
	\ex The fourth and last level are adverbs of negation\\
	\emph{aldrig} `never', \emph{inte} `not'
	\z 
\ex Examples of multiple adverbs
	\ea
	\gll De har ju\textsubscript{1} därför\textsubscript{2} faktiskt\textsubscript{3} aldrig\textsubscript{4} rest utomlands.\\
	they have certainly therefore actually never traveled abroad\\
	\glt `They have therefore actually never traveled abroad'
	\ex
	\gll Vi får väl\textsubscript{1} ändå\textsubscript{2} {trots allt}\textsubscript{3} inte\textsubscript{4} ge upp.\\
	we must nevertheless despite everything not give up\\
	\glt `We must nevertheless despite everything not give up'
